# CSE541-Computer-Vision-2022-The-Weekenders

## Introdution

This project presents a traffic sign detection and recognition system based on a Convolutional neural network. In this project we are using EfficientNetB0 neural network architecture to create a model based on our own custom dataset. Training model in this project involves preprocessing the images, so that it can handle the system even in the foggy weather condition. This project is focused on two subproblems first,image is taken from the IEEE dataset And the second subproblem is repeating the process of training and testing to achieve the accepted result.
